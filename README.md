# File-Search
Just a simple File Search Application using Python

Python Lib used - OS, Pickle, PySimpleGUI

Currently it is just for searching files within Windows.
The file_search.py alone is sufficient to search for files within the Windows system.
The GUI version will need all 3 files. It is a simple GUI version of the application built with PySimpleGUI lib.

If you are running just the file_search.py please update the test1 function (s.create_new_index and s.search) to modify search parameters
